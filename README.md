##We got stuck

- Trying to make post request to api. Got mixed up with all the different methods, should we redirect, should we use basic authentication, do we need the access token?

- We think we've handled this now.

- Are we authenticated or not?
- Bad credentials
- Now made post request what are the next steps, what do we do with body text that we recieve back.
